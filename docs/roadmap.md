# Roadmap

What is merely *designed* belongs in the architecture docs; what is *planned*
belongs here. A defect that has been fixed needs no entry anywhere — the commit
that fixed it, and the test that holds it fixed, are the record. The limitations
imposed on us from outside are recorded beside the mechanism they constrain, which
is the only place they can be read in context.

## Planned

### macOS login-window service

The `SMAppService` LaunchAgent runs only in the signed-in user's Aqua session, so
the agent stops at logout and cannot be reached from the macOS login screen. Currently if the screen is locked, the user must unlock it before remotex can connect. 

The shape of an answer is established: RealVNC's
[Service Mode](https://help.realvnc.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002253238-Understanding-RealVNC-Server-Modes)
and RustDesk's installed-service mode both provide login-window access, by
installing launch components that declare the `LoginWindow` session type
alongside `Aqua` instead of relying on per-user `SMAppService`.

Nothing past that shape is settled, and none of it should be designed here first.
What has to be measured on a real Mac: how the single listener is held across the
login transition and fast user switching, where a config and private key readable by both
the configured user and the UID 0 login-window process should live, and whether
Screen Recording and Accessibility grants reach the signed app in the
`LoginWindow` session at all.

FileVault is the one boundary none of it crosses: no remote-access process runs
before pre-boot disk unlock.


## Not planned

### Multiple sessions

remotex permanently has one active session slot. A new browser takes over and
evicts the previous holder. Concurrent sessions, shared sessions, and a session
broker are outside the product model.
